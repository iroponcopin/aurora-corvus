/* Aurora Corvus — the home page's opening beat, glyph half.
 *
 * Loaded by build_home.py only (extra_head), deferred, after main.js's own
 * contract. Read hero-mark.css first: it explains the whole opening. This
 * file is responsible for exactly ONE thing, and it is not "playing the
 * animation" — the mark's entire arrival is declarative CSS that needs no
 * script at all.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR
 * style.css paints the wordmark by putting a gradient on the <h1> and
 * clipping it to the text (`background-clip: text`, `color: transparent`).
 * Under that model the ink belongs to the <h1>, not to the glyphs — and the
 * moment a glyph is TRANSFORMED, the parent's text clip and the glyph's own
 * position disagree about where that letter is, so it paints twice, offset,
 * and the two copies union into a solid dilated slab. That is not a
 * prediction: it shipped that way for one round and the "A" rendered as a
 * white blob for the whole 0.8s of its animation, in headless Chrome 151 at
 * both device scale factors and with and without GPU raster. Hiding the
 * glyphs made the blob vanish; clearing the <h1>'s own background-image with
 * the glyphs left alone fixed it outright.
 *
 * So each glyph has to carry its own background, and hero-mark.css has to
 * take the <h1>'s away (`.is-lit { background-image: none }`). If each glyph
 * then simply repeated the gradient, the word would read as twelve little
 * gradients instead of one long one, which is worse than not animating at
 * all. So every glyph gets the SAME gradient, sized to the whole word and
 * offset by that glyph's own position — one continuous ramp, twelve
 * independently animatable boxes.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing here:
 *   1. The gradient is COPIED off the <h1>'s computed style rather than
 *      restated. style.css stays the single source of truth for the
 *      wordmark's colour, and the copy is re-taken when the theme changes.
 *   2. Positions are read with offsetLeft/offsetTop, never
 *      getBoundingClientRect(). The glyphs are already carrying the `from`
 *      keyframe's transform by the time this runs (animation-fill-mode:
 *      both), so their client rects are the ANIMATED rects; offset* is the
 *      layout position and is transform-free. Reading rects here produces a
 *      gradient that is subtly wrong for exactly as long as the animation
 *      runs, and right afterwards — which is the kind of bug that survives a
 *      screenshot taken at the end.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE
 * Nothing in this file runs per frame, and nothing here touches scroll.
 * There is one layout read, at startup, and one more per resize/theme change
 * — all outside any scroll or animation path. It adds no listener that can
 * fire during a scroll or a touch.
 *
 * FAILURE MODE
 * If anything here throws or never runs, `is-lit` is never added; every
 * per-glyph rule in hero-mark.css is gated on it, so the wordmark falls
 * straight back to style.css's own `film-in` fade. The mark is unaffected
 * either way.
