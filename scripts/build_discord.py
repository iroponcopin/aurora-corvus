"""Builds /discord/ in every language: how to use the Aurora Corvus Discord bot.

Two sources, deliberately split
-------------------------------
* STRUCTURE comes from data/discord_commands.json, which is exported straight
  from the bot's real command tree by discord-release-bot/export_commands.py.
  Which commands exist, what parameters they take, which need Manage Server --
  none of that is typed here, so a renamed subcommand cannot leave the page
  describing something that no longer exists. The bot's own test suite fails
  if that export goes stale (discord-release-bot/tests/test_export.py).
* MEANING comes from data/discord_bot.json, which is written by hand in all
  thirteen languages. Discord's own command descriptions are English (Discord
  resolves them from each READER's client locale, not from the server), so
  reprinting them would leave twelve languages reading an English table.

The two are checked against each other at build time: every command in the
export must have a gloss in every language, and every gloss must correspond to
a real command. Either kind of drift stops the build rather than rendering a
page with blank rows or documenting a command nobody can run.

The invite link is NOT rebuilt here -- it comes from build_download.py's
_discord_invite(), the same function the Download page uses, so the two pages
cannot offer different links. The permission number in data/discord.json is
checked against the one the bot actually asks for.
