"""Builds ouka/index.html — the OUKA brand page, for every language.

Owner directive (2026-09-12, IROHA, verbatim):

    新ブランドOUKAを展開
    ブランド名称:英→OUKA、漢→桜花
    ブランド位置:OUKA→Cherry→Alpha(※左から順に上位ブランド)
    (Aureumは別ジャンルModsなので含まれない)
    ブランドロゴをデザインフォルダーに追加しています。ウェブサイトに表示して
    今までにない圧倒的な品質とアニメーションでその名を轟かせ披露してください。

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What the page says — and what it must never say
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This page is built to the shape the owner arrived at for Cherry, after he
rejected two earlier drafts of that page (his words are quoted in full in
build_cherry.py's header). Two things, and nothing else:

  1. Where OUKA sits — said once, as a fact, not argued. He put it at the top
     of the line: OUKA → Cherry → Alpha, 左から順に上位ブランド.
  2. The release that is on offer. Until V1.0.0 this was a closing line in the
     register of 乞うご期待. Now it is the release itself, in the shape Cherry's
     page gave its own: the version and name, ONE line in the same register,
     the download, and the facts a player checks before installing (what it
     needs, how big the file is, its SHA-256). Every figure is read from the
     file in downloads/ and from the fabric.mod.json inside it — none is typed
     here.

NOT on this page, by his word on Cherry, which governs here because this is the
same kind of page: where the name comes from; that there is no compromise
(self-evident, and saying it cheapens the brand); what it contains — there is
no feature list, and the install and play guide travels inside the zip
(README.txt); any status, progress, "not yet", "coming later", build, or
schedule. Before V1.0.0 OUKA had no published build, and that is why none of
this could be written down, in either direction; the release block now states
only what the file itself proves. Every one of the 13 languages carries its own
copy; nothing falls back to English.

「桜花」はこのページには出さない。所有者が挙げたのはブランド名称としての表記
(「ブランド名称:英→OUKA、漢→桜花」)であって、ページに載せる文言としてではない。
承認を得た Cherry のページの形は「ブランドの位置」と「結びの一行」だけで、漢字
表記は無い。所有者が日本語版に置きたいと言えば KANJI = {"ja": "桜花"} と書けば
戻る(一行)。それまでは出さない——見せていないものを勝手に足さない。

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The release block (OUKA V1.0.0 "The Apex Artifact", released 2026-09-20)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * The line claims only what the zip's own README.txt states: the box
    addressed to the player arrives at dawn ("HOW IT BEGINS"). It names no
    feature and makes no promise.
  * The page refuses to build without an OUKA zip of V1.0.0 or later. The
    pre-release line is gone from the code, so a missing file cannot quietly
    turn a released product back into "coming soon" — it stops the build.
  * The line and the codename were written for one version (COPY_FOR). A newer
    zip in downloads/ stops the build until its own line and name are written,
    so an old line can never be printed over a new release.
  * The download button is in the mark's own two colours; its label, "File
    size" and "SHA-256" are the Download page's own translations
    (data/i18n/<lang>.json "download"), with no fallback.
  * Versions, the size, the hash and the codename carry dir="ltr": on the
    Arabic page bidi mirroring would print "≥" as "≤" and reorder
    "0.154.2+26.2". The codename also carries lang="en", because the edition
    line is set in capitals and a Turkish page would capitalise its i as İ.
  * The block enters where the closing line did (.ou-fade at RELEASE_START_MS,
    the same moment), so the entrance keeps its order and its timing.
  * scripts/check_ouka_release.py judges the rendered pages against the file
    independently (it imports nothing from here) and is run by check_site.py.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mark, and the animation the owner asked for
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mark is cut out of the logo photograph the owner supplied, and it is the
MARK ONLY — his standing instruction for every one of these logos is
「ロゴにはテキストが含まれていますがこれは一切使用せずロゴだけを切り取り
使用してください」, so the word OUKA under it in the photograph is not used;
the <h1> below the mark is the name.

「今までにない圧倒的な品質とアニメーション」 is the brief, so the blossom is not
animated as one flat picture. It was TAKEN APART, by measurement, into its five
petals and the α at its centre (scripts written for this page, kept in the
scratchpad; the parts they produced are committed as assets/img/ouka/petal-N-*
and core-*):

  * The centre of the mark's five-fold symmetry is at (51.04%, 53.70%) of the
    image — found by minimising |A − A rotated 72°| over candidate centres.
    Controls: the error rises monotonically as the centre is moved off it
    (59.9 → 61.6 → 68.6 → 82.8 at +6/+12/+24 px), and a half-step rotation of
    36° scores 112.8 against 59.9 for 72°.
  * The petals are seated at 53.57° + 72k (image space, 0 = +x, y down). Found
    as the phase of the 5th angular harmonic, which carries 0.246 of the mark's
    angular mass against ≤ 0.043 for every other harmonic except its own 10th
    (0.118 — each petal has one facet seam down its middle, which is why there
    are ten half-petals below and not five).
    ★ The first phase fit came out 36° wrong, i.e. pointing at the clefts. The
      control that caught it: mean radial mass at the claimed tips must exceed
      that at the claimed clefts, and it was 0.24× instead. A tip is where the
      mark HAS mass. An animation built on the unchecked fit would have hinged
      every petal about the gap between two petals.
  * The split itself is by connected components at alpha ≥ 180 (ten half-petals
    in five pairs, one per measured tip, plus the α glyph), after which every
    remaining pixel with alpha > 0 — the anti-aliased edges and the whole outer
    glow — is grown outward to the nearest part. So the six layers PARTITION
    the mark: their composite is the mark itself, alpha max |Δ| = 0 at 584 px
    (1 at 320 px, where 6 pixels of glow are lost), colour mean |Δ| 2.06 from
    webp quantisation alone. There is no seam, no double-darkened edge, and no
    lost glow, because no pixel is in two layers or in none.
  * A circular clip for the α was measured and REJECTED: the glyph reaches
    r = 123 px while the petals begin at r = 45 px — they interleave radially,
    and a disc that held the whole glyph would have held four petals with it.
    That is why the α is a cut layer and not a CSS circle().

What the page then does with those parts, all in CSS, no JavaScript, no
library, no video, no SMIL:

  1. the five petals unfold into their seats — each hinged on the measured
     centre, from folded (rotate −26°, scale .62) to seated, 1250 ms each,
     staggered 130 ms apart, starting at the top petal and going clockwise
  2. the α settles into the middle of them, 1120 ms, landing at 2100 ms
  3. the wordmark's four glyphs rise, 90 ms apart
  4. and then it LIVES: one revolution every 90 s, a slow breath, two haloes
     breathing out of phase in the mark's own two colours, and a highlight
     that travels across the metal every 11 s. The alpha counter-turns inside
     that revolution so the letter never goes upside down -- see .ou-core-anchor.

Both halo colours and the wordmark's gradient are MEASURED off the mark's own
opaque pixels (alpha ≥ 235, 35,166 samples): the left half of the blossom is
#fed1dd, the right half #e6dbe1. Nothing on this page is coloured by a palette
someone invented next to the logo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traps, every one of which this repo has actually shipped
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ★ CSS `transform` REPLACES the element's other transform, so the turn, the
    breath and each petal's unfold cannot share an element — one silently
    erases the other. They are on .ou-turn, .ou-breathe and .ou-p.
  ★ The CSS below is NOT a format string. A mis-doubled brace once emitted
    broken CSS and a Cherry logo that never moved, for a day. Substitution is
    str.replace() of __TOKENS__, and main() refuses to write a page that still
    holds one.
  ★ A rotating rectangle sweeps its own diagonal — and this one turns about
    the FLOWER's centre, not the image's, so the sweep radius is the distance
    from that centre to the farthest corner of the artwork (420 of 584 px),
    not half the diagonal. FIT below is computed from the real pixels; at any
    larger size the glow would swing out over the name on every revolution.
  ★ Every animated element's BASE style is its FINISHED state, and the intro
    animations reach it via `backwards` fill. That is what makes
    prefers-reduced-motion correct: switching the animations off shows the
    finished mark, assembled and still — never a frozen frame 0.
  ★ --t0 (below) exists so the animation can be INSPECTED: a test copy of the
    page sets .ou-stage{--t0:-2400ms} and animation-play-state:paused to freeze
    every animation at a chosen moment with its stagger intact. Chrome's
    --virtual-time-budget does NOT advance CSS animations (measured: a
    10s/1000px box moved 5 px between budgets of 100 ms and 5000 ms), so
    without this hook the page could only ever be screenshotted at whatever
    instant the renderer happened to stop.
