"""Builds releases.json at the repo root — a small, stable, English-only
feed describing the current release. This is the "machine-readable feed"
the Discord release bot polls (see discord-release-bot/bot/poller.py) as
its fallback trigger, since this Wiki is a static site published by a
person running this build and pushing to GitHub Pages, not by a CI
pipeline that could call a webhook on its own.

Design note: same discipline as build_download.py — every fact here is
computed from the real shipped ZIP and data/*.json at build time, never
typed as a literal. This file's shape is a contract with a separate
project (discord-release-bot/bot/release.py's ReleasePayload) — do not
rename or drop fields without updating that project to match.
