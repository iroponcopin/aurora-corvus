"""Audits the rendered 404.html: one message section per language, correct
lang/dir, buttons that stay inside that language's own subtree, the inline
language resolver, and the CSS rules that reveal exactly one section.

  python3 scripts/check_404.py [repo]      # default: this file's repo

Instrument A only. It reads markup, so it can see that the resolver is PRESENT
but not that it BEHAVES; the behavioural half is a browser run against mocked
navigator.languages. Deliberately does not import site_common or build_404 —
every expectation is written out here by hand, so this cannot pass by agreeing
with the generator about a shared mistake.

⚠ The hreflang assertion at the bottom is written against <link rel="alternate">
  in <head> ONLY. The first version of it looked for the substring "hreflang"
  anywhere in the file and was red on the fixed page AND on the broken one — it
  was matching the language switcher's own <a hreflang="ja"> links, which are
  correct and have always been there. A red that fires in both states measures
  nothing.
