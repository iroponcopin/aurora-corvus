"""Gate: the sealed skin really is the shipped skin, and the PIN is nowhere in the repo.

Three claims, each of which can fail on its own:

  1. The blob in downloads/ decrypts, with the PIN from $AURORA_SKIN_PIN, to a
     png whose sha256 matches data/skin_gate.json AND matches the skin the
     game actually ships. A stale blob (skin changed, seal not re-run) fails
     here — that is the whole reason the manifest carries the plaintext hash.
  2. A wrong PIN is refused. Without this, a broken tag check would pass (1)
     and hand the file to anyone.
  3. The PIN appears in no committed file. This is the claim the owner asked
     for in as many words: 「PIN CODEはウェブサイト等には一切記載せず」.

Without $AURORA_SKIN_PIN this check is RED, not skipped. A gate nobody can run
is not a gate — and this one guards the one thing in the repository that must
never be committed.
