"""Gate: the sealed skin page is present, wired and NOT stale — without the PIN.

This is the half of the skin gate that needs no secret, so it can live in
scripts/check_site.py and run on every audit:

  * every language has a /skin/ page, and each one points at the blob with a
    path that actually resolves from that page's depth (the ja/non-ja prefix
    trap that has broken this site's scripts before);
  * the blob exists, starts with the ACSK1 magic, and its declared plaintext
    length matches its payload;
  * data/skin_gate.json's plaintext sha256 IS the sha256 of the skin the game
    ships — i.e. the page is handing out the current picture;
  * no page contains a four-or-more digit run inside the gate markup, so a
    future edit cannot quietly write the PIN into the HTML.

The claims that DO need the PIN (it decrypts; a wrong PIN is refused; the PIN
is in no committed file) live in scripts/check_skin_gate.py, which is run by
hand at release time with AURORA_SKIN_PIN set.
