"""Turn the owner's Corvus icon into the brand assets this site uses: the
favicon set and the Open Graph share card.

The icon is the raven (assets/img/brand/corvus-tile.png: the black-metal raven
with the cyan edge, cut from the owner's artwork on its own rounded tile), since
2026-10-03. The old bird — its silhouette, the header mark made from it, and the
artwork behind both — is retired: 「旧アイコンは完全廃止です。」 (owner,
2026-10-03). Nothing here draws it any more, and its files are gone.

Run it only when the source artwork changes:

    python3 scripts/make_brand_assets.py

It is NOT part of scripts/build.py — the outputs are committed binaries, and
regenerating them on every page build would churn the repo for nothing.

Source of truth: assets/img/brand/corvus-tile.png, committed next to this
script so the whole set is reproducible instead of being a pile of mystery
binaries. Requires Pillow (`pip install Pillow`); if it is missing this script
says so and exits, it does not silently skip outputs.

Honest caveat: the raven icon is black on black with one cyan edge, so at
16px a favicon is mostly a dark tile with a cyan arc. It is the owner's design
and ships as drawn; a lifted small-size variant is a choice for them to make.
