# Launcher release discovery
#
# ⚠ This lives here, shared, on purpose. build_download.py and
#   build_glimpse_manifest.py each used to carry their own private copy of
#   "find the launcher jar", and both copies had the same two defects:
#
#     1. They globbed "glimpse-launcher-*.jar". The app was renamed to
#        Corvus in 1.3.0 and its files became corvus-1.3.0.*, so the glob
#        matched nothing — and because a missing jar is a *supported* state
#        ("no launcher published yet"), the manifest would have quietly
#        shipped with no "launcher" block at all and every installed
#        launcher's self-update would have gone dark. No error, no warning.
#     2. They took sorted(...)[0] — the lexicographically FIRST match, not
#        the newest. That is correct only while exactly one jar sits in the
#        folder. With two present it advertises the OLDER one, and by string
#        order "1.10.0" < "1.2.1", so the first double-digit minor release
#        would have silently downgraded every user.
#
#   Both names are matched (the pre-rename files are still served), and the
#   winner is chosen by a parsed NUMERIC version tuple.

      one — v1.3.2/2026-07-22 and v1.8.0/2026-08-04 — and a third label,
      v1.4.0, carries three entries on three different dates. Both readers of
      this file used to build `{(release, date): translation}` as a dict, so
      for those two pairs the SECOND translation silently won and rendered
      against BOTH structural entries. On all 13 published pages, v1.8.0's
      "Renamed to Glimpse Alpha" entry — the one explaining why the jar
      filenames changed — was replaced by a second copy of the config
      auto-repair text, wearing the rename's release badge. Nothing went red:
      the entry count was right, the badges were right, the dates were right,
      and both entries were fluent prose in the reader's own language.

      Every entry therefore carries an explicit `id`, assigned once and never
      recomputed, and that — not (release, date) — is what a translation is
      matched on. Appending a second entry for an existing release never
      forces the first one to be renamed, so ids are stable across the file's
      whole future.

    Both consumers go through this function and index_bundle_changelog()
    below, so there is exactly one place where an entry's identity is decided.
